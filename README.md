# 100 Days of Python  

This repo documents my journey through the [100 Days of Python Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).  
I’ll be building projects daily, from beginner to advanced, and tracking my progress here.

## About the Bootcamp
- Duration: 100 Days  
- Style: Project-based learning  
- Goal: Build real-world Python skills (beginner → advanced)

Each day has its own folder with:
