# Day 1: Band Name Generator

This is the **first project** from the [100 Days of Python Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

## Project Overview
The program creates a fun band name by asking for:
- The city you grew up in
- Your petâ€™s name  

It then combines them into a possible band name.

## How to Run
```bash
python band_name_generator.py

Follow the prompts and get your band name suggestion.

Example
Welcome to the Band Name Generator.
What's the name of the city you grew up in?
> Juba
What's your pet's name?
> Simba

Your band name could be Juba Simba
