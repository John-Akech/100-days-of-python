# Hangman Game üéØüêç

Day 7 of #100DaysOfCode

A classic **Hangman game** built in Python.  
The player guesses letters to uncover a hidden word. Wrong guesses reduce lives until the game is over.

---

## How It Works
1. Randomly select a word from a predefined list.
2. Display blanks for each letter in the word.
3. Ask the player to guess letters until the word is guessed or lives run out.
4. Track already guessed letters to prevent duplicates.
5. Show a visual representation of remaining lives using ASCII art.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/John-Akech/hangman-python.git

2. Navigate into the folder:
cd hangman-python
