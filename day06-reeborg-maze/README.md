# Maze Solver

Day 6 of #100DaysOfCode

A Python solution for navigating Reeborgâ€™s World **Maze Challenge**.  
The robot follows the "right-hand rule" to explore and find the path to the goal.

---

## How It Works
- Define a `turn_right()` function using repeated left turns.
- Move forward while possible, otherwise:
  - If the path to the right is clear â†’ turn right and move.
  - If the path ahead is clear â†’ move forward.
  - Otherwise â†’ turn left.

This ensures the robot keeps exploring until it reaches the goal.
